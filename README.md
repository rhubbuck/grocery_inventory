# grocery_inventory
c++ Project created to read in a text file that lists either: a)all items sold in a day or b) all items available in a store's inventory.
A backup file is created within the directory before the user is prompted with options of displaying data read in by the text file in the form of an itemized list, a histogram, or a search feature that returns the total number of items for a given user search.
A single class is implimented via grocerylist.cpp and grocerylist.h, with main() containing the user menu interaction loop for simplicity and modularity.
